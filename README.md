# Glut-Installer
Batch and PowerShell script for automating the glut library installation process for Visual Studio.

## Download Process
You can either clone the project or download it manually. I'd recommend downloading manually if you're not familiar with Git.
To download manually, click the green "Code" dropdown and then "Download ZIP".

## Installation Process
If you downloaded the project as a .zip, unzip/extract the files and then right-click the "Glut Installer.bat" and "Run as Administrator".
If you cloned the project, simply right-click the "Glut Installer.bat" and "Run as Administrator".

## Forewarning
***You'll probably get a "Windows protected your PC" warning. This is expected and it is safe to proceed. Click the "more info" text and then the â€œRun Anyway" button. This warning occurs because Windows takes caution with .bat files. Also, since the .bat file doesn't have a publisher and was downloaded from the Internet, Windows treats it with even more caution. You can (obviously) look at the source code if you have any suspicions.***
